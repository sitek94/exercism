# Exercism exercises

My solutions to Exercism exercises.

## Example usage

To make it easier to download an exercise I created `exercism-download.js`. It downloads the exercise and removes unnecessary files.

Instead of this:
```bash
$ exercism download --exercise=clock --track=javascript
```

You can use this:
```bash
$ npm run ed -- clock js
```
